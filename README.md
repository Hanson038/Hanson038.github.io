## **Me Beyond the Data**

Besides sticking with data, I also love playing the piano!
Practicing piano feels a lot like analyzing data. Reading music sheets is about discovering patterns too! You keep practice and practice and eventually you will creating something amazing—just like finding insights in a dataset! Both require dedication, creativity, and a love for uncovering hidden stories.
Whether it’s crafting melodies or memes, these hobbies remind me to balance the logical with the creative and bring joy to both work and play.
